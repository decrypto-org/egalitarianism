In this paper, we define the economic notion of cryptocurrency
"egalitarianism". We provide measurements of the egalitarianism of various
proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH and XMR. We find that
cryptocurrencies which were designed to be more egalitarian through memory
hardness indeed achieve this and quantify how successful each one is. We
measure the egalitarianism of two proof-of-stake-based cryptocurrencies, DCR
and ADA. Perhaps contrary to folklore belief, we find that proof-of-stake is
perfectly egalitarian in our model.

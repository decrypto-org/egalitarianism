\section{Introduction}

Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin} is the first and most successful \emph{cryptocurrency} to
date. It introduced \emph{blockchains}, a of cryptographic consensus protocol in
which \emph{transactions} are organized into \emph{blocks} which are put in a
mutually agreed sequence despite the presence of adversaries. Since its
inception, a plethora of other cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence, each
claiming its own features.

There are two ways in which a cryptocurrency can choose to achieve consensus in
the decentralized setting:
\emph{proof-of-work}~\cite{C:DwoNao92} and
\emph{proof-of-stake}~\cite{C:KRDO17}. The consensus mechanism defines the
mandates of block generation. In the case of proof-of-work, where block
generation is called \emph{mining}, blocks are produced by \emph{miners}
expending computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles. On the other hand,
in the case of proof-of-stake where block generation is called \emph{minting},
blocks are produced by \emph{minters} who ``stake'' their coins. In both cases,
during honest protocol executions, a leader is drawn at random from the
miners or minters population, with a probability of selection proportional to
their computational power or stake respectively. Block generators are
incentivized to produce blocks by receiving a \emph{reward} for each block they
successfully produce and which is subsequently adopted in the resulting
blockchain.

These rewards follow various schedules that are designed based on the
macroeconomic desiderada perceived by the architects of the cryptocurrency. For
example, the rate of coin production is \emph{halved} every $210,000$ blocks in
Bitcoin. Ethereum and Litecoin follow a similar schedule. On the contrary,
Monero has a \emph{smooth emission} schedule in which the rewards are gradually
reduced at every new block generated. The question of what this schedule should
be can have significant impact on the variance of stake ownership after an
execution of a sufficient number of protocol rounds and has been studied
extensively~\cite{equitability}. In this paper, we instead focus on the
comparison of the \emph{expected} returns of investors with different purchasing
power.

The central economic question pertains to cryptocurrency \emph{egalitarianism}.
In an ideal world, investing a certain amount of capital to mining or minting
should allow a participant to receive rewards proportional to their capital.
However, this is not the case with most cryptocurrencies. Specifically, in
the case of mining, there exist various tiers of mining hardware which have
vastly different performance. If one were to mine using a CPU, a GPU, an FPGA,
or specialized hardware such as ASICs, it would make a tremendous difference in
their success rate and, in turn, return on investment, despite the pricing of
the respective hardware not having a similarly vast difference in cost of
purchase. Though the term \emph{egalitarianism} has been left undefined, several
cryptocurrencies have claimed to achieve more egalitarianism than others.
However, lacking a comparable metric, the question of whether some
cryptocurrencies are more \emph{egalitarian} than others remains.

In this paper, we focus our research on four proof-of-work-based
cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. Bitcoin was chosen as
a baseline for comparison as the first and most successful cryptocurrency to
date. Ethereum is the most promising ``altcoin,'' as cryptocurrencies beyond
Bitcoin came to be known. Litecoin and Monero, although not next by market cap,
do make claims that they are more egalitarian because their mining puzzles are
based on hash functions which are claimed to be memory-hard. Memory-hardness
has the goal of making it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks
by requiring large amounts of memory, and hence are claimed to yield more
egalitarian cryptocurrencies.

On the proof-of-stake side, as will soon become clear, egalitarian behavior is
similar across all coins regardless of implementation. We study the case of a
pure proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, Cardano~\cite{C:KRDO17}, as well as a hybrid
work/stake cryptocurrency, Decred.

\textbf{Our contributions.}
Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We define an exact economic measure of cryptocurrency
        \emph{egalitarianism}.
        To do this, we first define the \emph{egalitarian curve} of a
        cryptocurrency from which we extract the measure.
  \item We measure and compare the egalitarianism curve and egalitarianism of
        four indicative proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, one representative
        proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, and a hybrid cryptocurrency, using
        current market data.
  \item We show that proof-of-stake is, perhaps unexpectedly, perfectly
        egalitarian.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}

Bitcoin~\cite{bitcoin} is the first and most successful \emph{cryptocurrency} to
date. It introduced \emph{blockchains}, a of cryptographic consensus protocol in
which \emph{transactions} are organized into \emph{blocks} which are put in a
mutually agreed sequence despite the presence of adversaries. Since its
inception, a plethora of other cryptocurrencies have sprung into existence, each
claiming its own features.

There are two ways in which a cryptocurrency can choose to achieve consensus in
the decentralized setting:
\emph{proof-of-work}~\cite{C:DwoNao92} and
\emph{proof-of-stake}~\cite{ouroboros}. The consensus mechanism defines the
mandates of block generation. In the case of proof-of-work, where block
generation is called \emph{mining}, blocks are produced by \emph{miners}
expending computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles. On the other hand,
in the case of proof-of-stake where block generation is called \emph{minting},
blocks are produced by \emph{minters} who ``stake'' their coins. In both cases,
during honest protocol executions, a leader is drawn at random from the
miners or minters population, with a probability of selection proportional to
their computational power or stake respectively. Block generators are
incentivized to produce blocks by receiving a reward for each block they
successfully produce and which is subsequently adopted in the resulting
blockchain.

A central economic question pertains to cryptocurrency \emph{egalitarianism}.
In an ideal world, investing a certain amount of capital to mining or minting
should allow a participant to receive rewards proportional to their capital.
However, this has not been the case with most cryptocurrencies. Specifically, in
the case of mining, there exist various tiers of mining hardware which have
vastly different performance. If one were to mine using a CPU, a GPU, an FPGA,
or specialized hardware such as ASICs, it would make a vast difference in their
success rate and, in turn, return on investment, despite the pricing of the
respective hardware not having a similarly vast difference in cost of purchase.
Though the term \emph{egalitarianism} has been left undefined, several
cryptocurrencies have claimed to achieve more egalitarianism than others.
However, lacking a comparable metric, the question of whether some
cryptocurrencies are more \emph{egalitarian} than others remains.

In this paper, we focus our research on four proof-of-work-based
cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. Bitcoin was chosen as
a baseline for comparison as the first and most successful cryptocurrency to
date. Ethereum is the most promising ``altcoin,'' as cryptocurrencies beyond
Bitcoin came to be known. Litecoin and Monero, although not next by market cap,
do make claims that they are more egalitarian because their mining puzzles are
based on hash functions which are claimed to be memory-hard. Memory-hardness
has the goal of making it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks
by requiring large amounts of memory, and hence are claimed to yield more
egalitarian cryptocurrencies.

On the proof-of-stake side, as will soon become clear, egalitarian behavior is
similar regardless of implementation. We study the case of a pure proof-of-stake
cryptocurrency, Cardano~\cite{ouroboros}, as well as a hybrid work/stake
cryptocurrency, Decred.

\textbf{Our contributions.}
Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We define an exact economic measure of cryptocurrency
        \emph{egalitarianism}.
        To do this, we first define the \emph{egalitarian curve} of a
        cryptocurrency from which we extract the measure.
  \item We measure and compare the egalitarianism curve and egalitarianism of
        four indicative proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, one representative
        proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, and a hybrid cryptocurrency, using
        current market data.
  \item We show that proof-of-stake is, perhaps unexpectedly, perfectly
        egalitarian.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental results}\label{sec:experiments}

We have experimentally analyzed the egalitarianism of proof-of-work coins
Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. We chose these four as a representative
sample among the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin represents the
largest and most successful cryptocurrency by market cap. Litecoin is the first
cryptocurrency which aimed to become more egalitarian by replacing Bitcoin's
SHA256 work function with scrypt, a more memory-hard function. Ethereum is one
of the most promising cryptocurrencies, the first to support smart contracts,
and second largest by market cap; their work function is different from both
Bitcoin and Litecoin. Finally, Monero is a special case, because it claims
strong egalitarianism due to its memory-hard mining function, Cryptonight.
Furthermore, its protocol is often updated to maintain egalitarianism.

As expected, we show that Bitcoin is the least egalitarian of the four. Ethereum
follows next. Litecoin is more egalitarian, due to its use of scrypt. Finally,
Monero is the most egalitarian among the proof-of-work coins we have studied.

For our experimental setting, we worked as follows. First, we collected empirical
data which describe the available mining hardware options in the market. For
each machine choice, we determined the cost of investment. This is comprised
of its initial price to purchase (in USD) as well as its energy cost of
operation (in watts). The cost of operation was translated to USD per hour by
considering the electricity cost of KWh. As a reference, we used the KWh cost in
the United States in which $1$ KWh costs $0.10\$$. We remark that this reference
electricity cost is only for estimation and can vary depending on the country of
operation, contractual miner agreements with the power grid, or bulk pricing.
While we do extract exact numbers using this as our experimental basis, we note
here that the qualitative difference of egalitarianism across cryptocurrencies
(i.e., the shape of their egalitarian curve and the order of egalitarianism of
different cryptocurrencies) remains the same if the electricity cost is
adjusted.

\dionyziz{modify the above electricity cost to correspond to the data we use.}

\dionyziz{confirm that this adjustment maintains curve shapes?}

We then use the reported hash rate of the machine to extract an expectation of
the freshly mined coins it would generate per unit of time, if it were to run
continuously. This expectation is taken over the randomness of all honest
blockchain protocol executions. As such, each party is awarded block rewards in
proportion to their computational power. The difference between revenue per unit
of time and cost of operation per unit of time produces an \emph{income rate}
which is measured in USD per hour.

For our experiments, we use a duration of investment of $d = 1$
year. This choice of parameter is made arbitrarily to correspond to the usual
definition of ROI in traditional finance. Again this parameter does not make a
qualitative difference in our metrics.

To find the optimal investment strategy, we employ the following algorithm. The
initial capital available is allocated to an upfront technology investment in
which an integer Knapsack instance is solved to optimize the total cashflow.
Subsequently, as long as the cashflow is positive, the purchased machines are
run for the indicated total duration, reinvesting the freshly minted coins for
electricity costs to generate more coins. This strategy produces an income of
freshly generated coins which have not been spent and are reported as the
strategy's income.

To calculate our concrete numbers, define the following constants:

\dionyziz{Fill in the ``?'' in the above table}

Let $M$ denote the set of all available mining machine choices. For each machine
$m$, our empirically collected data specifies the following parameters: An
energy consumption rate $\ecr(m)$ (in Watts), an initial cost of purchase $\ic(m)$
(in USD), as well as a hash rate $\hr(m)$ (in Hz). Given the above, we can now
calculate the expected income rate $\mathbb{E}[\ir(m)]$ for a given machine $m$
and a cryptocurrency $c$:

\[
\mathbb{E}[\ir(m)] = 3600 \frac{\hr(m)}{\thr(c)}\br(c)\bgr(c)\tp(c) - \ecr(m) \ec
\]

There are many possible configurations for technology investments. In each
configuration $\overline{m} \subseteq M \times \mathbb{N}$, a number of copies
$n \in \mathbb{N}$ of every machine type $m \in M$ are purchased. The total
initial cost of investment for such a configuration is given:

\[
  \ic(\overline{m}) = \sum_{(m, n) \in \overline{m}}{n\ic(m)}
\]

The above figure is given in USD per hour. The strategy's reported net income
for the duration $d$ is then:

\[
  B_\textsc{OPT}(v)
  =
  \max{
    \{
      \sum_{(m, n) \in \overline{m}}
      {d\mathbb{E}[\ir(m)] - n\ic(m)}:
      \overline{m} \subseteq M \times \mathbb{N}
      \land
      \ic(\overline{m}) \leq v
    \}
  }
\]

Here, the maximum is taken over all possible machine configurations, yielding
the technology investment which maximizes the income rate.

As the simulation parameters are many and diverse, in order to allow others to
run the experiments with different values, as well as for reasons of
reproducibility and falsifiability, we openly release our mining investment
optimizer as well as our data for public use\footnote{

\section{Related work}\label{sec:related}
The macro and microeconomics of blockchain design have been studied from
several perspectives but remain an active area of research with a number of open questions.
Incentives for block generation
according to the honest protocol have been explored for both proof-of-work and
proof-of-stake.

Proof-of-work protocols such as Bitcoin were formalized in the Bitcoin
Backbone~\cite{EC:GarKiaLeo15,C:GarKiaLeo17} papers and follow-up
works~\cite{pass2017analysis}. The seminal work of Selfish
Mining~\cite{FC:EyaSir14,FC:SapSomZoh16} showed that the honest behavior is not
incentive-compatible in Bitcoin, but the protocol can be modified to behave
that way. However, in restricted models, Bitcoin can be shown to be incentive-compatible~\cite{kiayias2016blockchain}.  Proof-of-stake protocols such as
Ouroboros~\cite{C:KRDO17} can be designed from the ground up to be
incentive-compatible. The question of how to incentivize parties to conduct
pool formation into the desired number of pools, or groups of minters, was
studied in~\cite{bkks2018}.

The above works study the incentives of blockchain systems from the designer's
point of view so that participants do not deviate from the prescribed protocol.
A related question is how \emph{fair} the protocol is to participants
themselves, and in particular to honest participants. The Backbone and Selfish
Mining works include attacks in which an adversary can strategically harm
\emph{chain quality}, causing the number of blocks and, in turn, the respective
rewards, to be disproportionate to their contributed computational power, thereby
harming fairness against honest participants. Fruitchains~\cite{PODC:PasShi17}
proposes a protocol which solves this problem. In these works,
handing out rewards in exact proportion to computational power is considered
``fair.''

\emph{Egalitarianism}, in the way considered in the paper, has been studied in
proof-of-work systems from a technological point of view with respect to
\emph{memory-hard functions} in~\cite{alwen2017depth,biryukov2016egalitarian}.
However, the question
of whether computational power grows proportionally to capital invested, \ie
whether larger wealth results in more than proportional rewards, has not
been previously studied. Therefore, our work aims at filling this gap by
studying the effects of economies of scale when applied to cryptocurrency
generation.

\noindent\textbf{Equitability of cryptocurrencies.}
Fanti \textit{et al.} analyze economic blockchain fairness
in~\cite{equitability}, where they define \emph{equitability}. They study the
evolution of a system after a series of rounds, putting forth the property that
stake ownership remains in proportion \emph{before} and \emph{after} rewards
have been awarded. By studying the behaviour of the returns' \emph{variance}
under the randomness of executions, they show that the distribution of capital
follows a Pólya process. Our work augments their results by quantifying the \emph{expectation}
of rewards and then studying the variance under the randomness of initial capital
allocation. In our work, we show that
computational power is not proportional to the invested capital, and hence the
analogy between proof-of-work computational power and proof-of-stake capital
breaks down, and a more detailed study is needed. Additionally, we remark that
proof-of-work miners also reinvest their proceeds in the mining operation,
albeit slowly, as proof-of-stake minters do. For example, empirical data show
that large-scale miners pay for electricity using their
proceeds~\cite{kharif2018}. Hence, both mining and minting follow Pólya
processes as modelled by their paper.
Regardless, \emph{egalitarianism} and \emph{equitability} are orthogonal. A
cryptocurrency can be perfectly egalitarian and poorly equitable and vice versa.
It is possible to obtain a cryptocurrency both egalitarian and equitable by
adopting correctly parameterized proof-of-stake under a geometric reward
function.
